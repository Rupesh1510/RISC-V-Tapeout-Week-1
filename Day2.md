# Day 2: 

## Decoding tt_025C_1v80 in the SKY130 PDK

    tt: Typical process corner.
    025C: Represents a temperature of 25Â°C, relevant for temperature-dependent performance.
    1v80: Indicates a core voltage of 1.8V.

This naming convention clarifies which process, voltage, and temperature conditions the library models.

## Opening and Exploring the .lib File

1. Open the file:

```
gedit sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

```
